# Risk Register (V1)

## R1: Participation bias
- Risk: Players with more engaged families/coaches participate, skewing data.
- Mitigation: Document recruitment method; compare participants vs nonparticipants where possible; avoid causal claims.

## R2: Exposure bias in outcome labels
- Risk: College attainment reflects visibility and connections, not just ability.
- Mitigation: Track exposure proxies where possible; interpret outcomes as “attainment given exposure.”

## R3: Self-report noise
- Risk: Training/film/job hours may be inaccurate.
- Mitigation: Use coarse bins; sanity checks; treat as noisy; sensitivity analyses.

## R4: Harm from misclassification
- Risk: False negatives could hide players; false positives could waste evaluator time.
- Mitigation: Uncertainty thresholds; “insufficient data” outputs; human-in-the-loop.

## R5: Privacy breach
- Risk: Identifiable info leaked.
- Mitigation: Separate ID mapping; restricted access; no public player-level outputs.

## R6: Misuse of tool
- Risk: Tool used as a ranking / exclusion system.
- Mitigation: Explicit use restrictions; no rankings; documentation; watermark outputs as decision-support.
