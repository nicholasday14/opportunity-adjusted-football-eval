# Data Security (V1)

- Store anonymized modeling data in /data/processed.
- Store identifying mapping (if any) separately and never commit it to GitHub.
- Add a .gitignore rule to prevent accidental commits of raw forms/exports.
- Share data only in anonymized form.
- No player names, schools, phone numbers, emails, or exact addresses in the repo.
