# Data Schema (V1)
## Identifiers
- player_id (string): Random unique ID, no identifying information
- position_group (categorical): QB, RB, WR, OL, DL, LB, DB, ST

## Performance Metrics
- games_played (int)
- snaps_estimate (int)
- production_metric (float): Position-normalized (e.g., yards, pressures, tackles)
- touchdowns_or_equivalent (int)
- honors_binary (bool): Any all-league / team honors

## Team & Competition Context
- school_size (int)
- competition_level (categorical): low / medium / high
- team_win_pct (float)
- program_resource_bucket (categorical): low / medium / high

## Development Inputs
- training_hours_per_week (float)
- coaching_hours_per_week (float)
- weight_room_access_days (int): per week
- film_hours_per_week (float)
- offseason_participation_weeks (int)

## Opportunity Constraints
- job_hours_per_week (float)
- commute_minutes (int)
- missed_offseason_binary (bool)

## Outcome Labels
- college_roster_binary (bool)
- college_level (categorical): P5 / G5 / FCS / none
- year1_snaps_bucket (categorical): none / low / medium / high

## Notes & Assumptions
- All non-outcome variables are measured at the high school level.
- Self-reported inputs are treated as noisy and non-causal.
- Outcome labels may reflect exposure bias and are interpreted accordingly.
- Models will report uncertainty and avoid deterministic claims.

## Allowed Values & Measurement Rules

### position_group
- Allowed: QB, RB, WR, OL, DL, LB, DB, ST
- Rule: Use primary position for evaluation; do not multi-label in V1.

### competition_level
- Allowed: low, medium, high
- Rule: Assign based on league/classification + strength-of-schedule proxy (document method).

### program_resource_bucket
- Allowed: low, medium, high
- Rule: Based on school football resources, not family income. Use a rubric.

### honors_binary
- Allowed: true/false
- Rule: true if any verified all-conference/all-state/team captain-type honor.

### snaps_estimate
- Rule: If exact snaps unavailable, estimate using games_played * typical snaps by position, and mark in notes later (V2 adds a confidence flag).

### production_metric
- Rule: Store raw stat in data collection, normalize later by position (V1 keeps one numeric placeholder to avoid exploding columns).

### offseason_participation_weeks
- Rule: Count weeks of structured offseason training participation in last 12 months.

### missed_offseason_binary
- Allowed: true/false
- Rule: true if player missed >= 4 consecutive offseason weeks due to constraints (not injury).

### year1_snaps_bucket
- Allowed: none, low, medium, high
- Rule: Define cutoffs in evaluation docs once you pick a data source for college snaps.
